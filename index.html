<p>Paul Stubbs</p>
<p>s3609575@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p>My name is Paul Stubbs, I recently turned 32 and I am a father, I was born in Queensland and moved to Victoria when I was 8 Years old.
I have never left the country of Australia.
I left high school during year 11 as I had an offer for an apprenticeship as a baker (completed);
I do regret leaving school as I feel that it has affected my opportunities as an adult.
I am a avid gamer, my steam library has over 680 games (Humble Brag), I highly enjoy VR games and I am excited to see what happens
over the next 5 years in the VR industry (Fingers Crossed For Full Dive).</p>

<p>I have had a interest in computers (IT) since I was a young lad, But I started to get more into PC building after I completed my Baking Apprenticeship,
at this time I did my first part upgrades for a PC, I had the most powerful sense of achievement when the upgrade was done without issues.
Now I am doing upgrades, fresh builds and networking for family almost every other week.</p>

<p>I have chosen to study for a Bachelor of IT to further employment opportunities I chose to study with RMIT as they are well known and respected
and they allow me to do most of the work online which is very helpful.
I hope to learn every thing that I need to be able to join the ADF as an officer in the IT/Communications field.</p>

<p>I hope to learn and gain lots of experience in setting up communications networks in remote locations via Satellites/Starlink.
I intend to do a few years in the ADF while learning as much as I can, during this time I intend to get my Pilots License.
Once I have finished with the ADF I intend to take my skills and setup a IT/Communications Company that will specialize in remote/satellite Networks,
with on call support and the ability to fly anywhere in the country.</p>

<p>As my ideal job is to own my own IT company that deals with remote locations,
I have added a link to a company that has very similar services as to what I would like to provide
<a href="https://www.ciphertel.com/mining-communications/">Link</a></p>

<p>This company provides a robust communications/networking package including power systems for extreme remote location setups the challenge of such a setup would be very
rewarding. Some of the skills that I will need to learn to complete this role are; Mobile phone signals (LTE), Advanced Wifi knowledge (WiMax), Multiple location secure
network access.</p>

<p>Although I have a experience and some knowledge of Wifi and LAN, I do believe that my knowledge is laughable compared to what is required.
I believe that after completing my Bachelor of IT that I will be closer to the level of knowledge required for this position;
After completing several years as a Signals Officer in the ADF I believe I will have the knowledge and skills required for such a company,
I will fill in any gaps with courses and degrees that I will need.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>MBTI style test done via <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities</a> provided a result of Advocate personality type. I must say the results
  are quite informitive and I wouldn't disagree with the results. I believe that Advocate personality type would make a perfect team member as they believe in teamwork.</p>
<p>A personality test I took was by <a href="https://www.truity.com/view/tests/big-five-personality">Truity</a>
  they score you based on a system they call "OCEAN", Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism. All five of these are very important
  qualities for any group activity. My results are shown in the graph below.</p>

<p>A learning style test I took provided by <a href="http://www.whatismylearningstyle.com/learning-style-test-1.html">whats my learning style</a> was interesting, I scored
  "Visual Learner" which wasnt much of a surprise to me as I have always found it easier to learn by the old adage "Monkey see, Monkey do"</p>
