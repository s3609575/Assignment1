Paul Stubbs
s3609575@student.rmit.edu.au

My name is Paul Stubbs, I recently turned 32 and I am a father, I was born in Queensland and moved to Victoria when I was 8 Years old.
I have never left the country of Australia.
I left high school during year 11 as I had an offer for an apprenticeship as a baker (completed);
I do regret leaving school as I feel that it has affected my opportunities as an adult.
I am a avid gamer, my steam library has over 680 games (Humble Brag), I highly enjoy VR games and I am excited to see what happens
over the next 5 years in the VR industry (Fingers Crossed For Full Dive).

I have had a interest in computers (IT) since I was a young lad, But I started to get more into PC building after I completed my Baking Apprenticeship,
at this time I did my first part upgrades for a PC, I had the most powerful sense of achievement when the upgrade was done without issues.
Now I am doing upgrades, fresh builds and networking for family almost every other week.

I have chosen to study for a Bachelor of IT to further employment opportunities I chose to study with RMIT as they are well known and respected
and they allow me to do most of the work online which is very helpful.
I hope to learn every thing that I need to be able to join the ADF as an officer in the IT/Communications field.

I hope to learn and gain lots of experience in setting up communications networks in remote locations via Satellites/Starlink.
I intend to do a few years in the ADF while learning as much as I can, during this time I intend to get my Pilots License.
Once I have finished with the ADF I intend to take my skills and setup a IT/Communications Company that will specialize in remote/satellite Networks,
with on call support and the ability to fly anywhere in the country.

As my ideal job is to own my own IT company that deals with remote locations,
I have added a link to a company that has very similar services as to what I would like to provide
https://www.ciphertel.com/mining-communications/

This company provides a robust communications/networking package including power systems for extreme remote location setups the challenge of such a setup would be very
rewarding. Some of the skills that I will need to learn to complete this role are; Mobile phone signals (LTE), Advanced Wifi knowledge (WiMax), Multiple location secure
network access.

Although I have a experience and some knowledge of Wifi and LAN, I do believe that my knowledge is laughable compared to what is required.
I believe that after completing my Bachelor of IT that I will be closer to the level of knowledge required for this position;
After completing several years as a Signals Officer in the ADF I believe I will have the knowledge and skills required for such a company,
I will fill in any gaps with courses and degrees that I will need.
