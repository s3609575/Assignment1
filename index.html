<p><h1><b>My Profile</b></h1></p>
<p>My name is Paul Stubbs, I recently turned 32 and I am a father, I was born in Queensland and moved to Victoria when I was 8 Years old.
I have never left the country of Australia.
I left high school during year 11 as I had an offer for an apprenticeship as a baker (completed);
I do regret leaving school as I feel that it has affected my opportunities as an adult.
I am a avid gamer, my steam library has over 680 games (Humble Brag), I highly enjoy VR games and I am excited to see what happens
over the next 5 years in the VR industry (Fingers Crossed For Full Dive).</p>

<p>I have had a interest in computers (IT) since I was a young lad, But I started to get more into PC building after I completed my Baking Apprenticeship,
at this time I did my first part upgrades for a PC, I had the most powerful sense of achievement when the upgrade was done without issues.
Now I am doing upgrades, fresh builds and networking for family almost every other week.</p>

<p>I have chosen to study for a Bachelor of IT to further employment opportunities I chose to study with RMIT as they are well known and respected
and they allow me to do most of the work online which is very helpful.
I hope to learn every thing that I need to be able to join the ADF as an officer in the IT/Communications field.</p>

<p>I hope to learn and gain lots of experience in setting up communications networks in remote locations via Satellites/Starlink.
I intend to do a few years in the ADF while learning as much as I can, during this time I intend to get my Pilots License.
Once I have finished with the ADF I intend to take my skills and setup a IT/Communications Company that will specialize in remote/satellite Networks,
with on call support and the ability to fly anywhere in the country.</p>
<p><h4>Ideal Job</h4></p>
<p>As my ideal job is to own my own IT company that deals with remote locations,
I have added a link to a company that has very similar services as to what I would like to provide
<a href="https://www.ciphertel.com/mining-communications/">Link</a></p>

<p>This company provides a robust communications/networking package including power systems for extreme remote location setups the challenge of such a setup would be very
rewarding. Some of the skills that I will need to learn to complete this role are; Mobile phone signals (LTE), Advanced Wifi knowledge (WiMax), Multiple location secure
network access.</p>

<p>Although I have a experience and some knowledge of Wifi and LAN, I do believe that my knowledge is laughable compared to what is required.
I believe that after completing my Bachelor of IT that I will be closer to the level of knowledge required for this position;
After completing several years as a Signals Officer in the ADF I believe I will have the knowledge and skills required for such a company,
I will fill in any gaps with courses and degrees that I will need.</p>
<p></p>
<p><h4><b>3 Personality Tests</b></h4></p>
<p>MBTI style test done via <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities</a> provided a result of Advocate personality type. I must say the results
  are quite informitive and I wouldn't disagree with the results. I believe that Advocate personality type would make a perfect team member as they believe in teamwork.</p>
<p>A personality test I took was by <a href="https://www.truity.com/view/tests/big-five-personality">Truity</a>
  they score you based on a system they call "OCEAN", Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism. All five of these are very important
  qualities for any group activity. My results are shown in the graph below.</p>

<p>A learning style test I took provided by <a href="http://www.whatismylearningstyle.com/learning-style-test-1.html">whats my learning style</a> was interesting, I scored
  "Visual Learner" which wasnt much of a surprise to me as I have always found it easier to learn by the old adage "Monkey see, Monkey do"</p>

<p><h4><b>Project Idea</b></h4></p>
<p><h5><b>USB 3 Transmiter/Reciever</b></h5></p>
<p>I believe that there is a need in the computer accessories market for a peripheral that transmits data at USB 3.0 speeds (5Gbps).
  This device at a basic level will consist of two components. A "Transmitter" and a "Receiver".  The "Transmitter" will have a USB female
  port to plug your USB device into, it will also have a power pack that will power the device for and the attached USB device for at least 4 hours,
  the transmitter in the transmitter device will be the new WiFi 6. The "Receiver" will plug into a PCI slot on your computer and will operate a wireless network,
  the software included will allow for customization of the network and allow multiple devices to be added.</p>

<p>My personal motivation behind this idea is the fact I am a avid gamer and have a lot of peripherals and the cable mess is nightmarish. I also enjoy VR,
  the Oculus VR system uses camera sensors that perform best at USB 3.0 speeds, but in order to get room scale game play you need to run 5-10 meters of USB extension cables,
  which provide a tripping hazard and technical difficulties trying to get USB 3 speeds, as you will need to provide the cables with external power sources.
  I believe that this Project Idea will be very useful in this situation.</P>

<p>As stated above I believe this Project Idea will consist of two (2) main hardware components and at least 1 major software component.
  The wireless technology (WiFi 6) for this Project Idea here fore referred to as "Project" is not available as it is still in development.
  Wifi 6 is predicted to have WiFi speeds of 9.6Gbps which will allow up to two (2) USB 3.0 devices to be connected as USB 3.0 has speeds of 5Gbps.
  The transmitter Device will require a power pack built into it I believe that a detachable and separate recharging dock would be a good business choice as it
  will allow the battery pack to be upgraded with new battery technologies as time progresses. The main technical issue in regards to the batteries is working out how
  much power the system will require to operate for four (4) hours while providing power to a connected device and powering the WiFi 6 hardware.</p>

<p>The Receiver which will be inserted into a PCI Express 4.0 slot as this will allow for massive data transfer speeds allowing the system to handle multiple Wifi 6
  incoming signals from Transmitters. Due to the fact that WiFi 6 appears to handle only two (2) USB 3.0 amounts of data (9.6 Gbps) we would need to place at least two
  (2) WiFi transmitters on the PCIE Card which will allow 19.2 Gbps transfer speeds which will allow us to handle four (4) USB 3.0 connections which will make the
  Project more commercially attractive. The software will be required to be able to load balance between the two (2) transmitters in order to provide the best possible
   connection with minimal latency. The software will need a user interface that will allow users to add the wireless USB Transmitters with minimal fuss.
   Security will be an issue for the users so the software will need to allow us to secure the Wifi Signals.</p>

<p>In order to complete the Project we will require skills in the following areas;
Hardware Engineering: A Hardware Engineering will be required to create a small package device with an external power pack while also providing sufficient
room to allow circuitry for a USB 3.0 type A female connection point and a Wifi 6 transmitter and any cooling that may be required. The hardware engineer will
also need to create the PCIE card that has 2 Wifi 6 transmitters.</p>

<p>Software Engineering: A Software Engineer will be required to create the software for both the transmitter and the receiver while also creating the user
  interface software.</p>

<p>If we can manage this Project we will solve every gamers issue of peripheral cable nightmare as it is solved by the use of wireless technology,
if we make our transmitter software open sourced it will allow other peripheral companies such as Logitech to make wireless peripherals that will
use our product which will greatly increase the appeal behind the Project.</p>
<p>This will solve a lot of the peripheral issues that most true gamers have.</p>
